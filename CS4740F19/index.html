	<br> Please use the course Piazza for course-related questions. Email me for logistical issues/other such concerns.
	<br> I will post lecture notes periodically on Piazza. Theses notes are designed to accompany lectures. As a consequence, I may delay some of the notes to finalize them, feel free to email me for the draft version.
	<br> If you are interested in research in NLP, please contact me, I will be readily available. I can also help you approach Claire or other NLP/ML/AI faculty.
