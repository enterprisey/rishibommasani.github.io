				<p> My research focuses on 

My research focuses on data understanding for NLP as a mechanism for inducing useful guarantees and improving downstream performance of (neural) models. In general, I am interested in injecting soundness into modern NLP systems without compromising performance.
					
I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/">Claire Cardie</a> during my undergraduate years at Cornell. She currently chairs my thesis committee along with <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/">Bobby Kleinberg</a>. I have spent two summers as a research intern in the <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/machine-learning/">DeepSpeech (Speech, NLP, & ML)</a> group at Mozilla, advised by Dr. Kelly Davis.
